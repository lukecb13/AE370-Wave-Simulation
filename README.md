# AE370 Project 2: Numerical Model for Waves with and without Forcing

## Overview

This project investigates how time-varying external forces, such as sinusoidal or random forces, influence wave propagation in mechanical systems like beams, plates, and strings. Numerical methods, particularly finite difference methods, are used to approximate wave behavior when analytical solutions are not feasible. The project applies to engineering fields like vibration analysis, seismic loading, and acoustics.

## Problem Statement

"How do time-varying external forces, such as sinusoidal or random forces, influence wave propagation in mechanical systems, and how can numerical methods simulate this behavior in systems where analytical solutions do not exist?"

## Goals

1. Model wave propagation through a medium subjected to time-varying external forces.
2. Analyze the impact of sinusoidal and random forces on wave behavior.
3. Use finite difference methods to approximate wave propagation.
4. Apply the model to real-world systems like machinery vibrations or seismic events.
